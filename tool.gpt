Param: FILE_PATH: The full path to the file to be renamed. Must be enclosed in double quotes if the path contains spaces or special characters.
Param: NEW_NAME: The new name for the file, without the extension. Special characters (like < > : " / \ | ? * ') will be replaced with underscores for safety.
