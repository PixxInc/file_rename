Description: Renames a file to a specified new name while preserving its original file extension. The tool sanitizes the new name by removing or replacing special characters that could cause issues with file handling.

Param: FILE_PATH: The full path to the file that you want to rename. **Enclose in double quotes** if it contains spaces or special characters.

Param: NEW_NAME: The desired new name for the file, without the file extension. Any special characters (like `< > : " / \ | ? * '`) will be replaced with underscores to ensure compatibility.
